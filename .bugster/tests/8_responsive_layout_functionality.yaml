name: Responsive Layout Functionality
page: /
page_path: app/page.tsx
task: Verifying the application layout adapts to different screen sizes
steps:
- Load the application on a desktop viewport
- Verify the TasksList, StatsCard components render in a grid with md:grid-cols-4
  for desktop
- Verify StatsDashboard displays all four cards in a single row on desktop
- Resize the browser to a mobile viewport size (below md breakpoint)
- Verify the StatsCard components stack vertically in grid-cols-1 layout
- Verify that all functionality (filtering, adding tasks, task operations) remains
  accessible on mobile view
- Verify that memoized components (TerminalHeader, TaskItem, etc.) render correctly
  at both viewport sizes
expected_result: UI components should reorganize appropriately between mobile and
  desktop viewports with all functionality remaining accessible and properly rendered
