task: Deleting a task from the task list
steps:
- Find an existing task in the TasksList component
- Locate the delete button (Trash2 icon) in the task's action area on the right side
- Click the Trash2 icon for that task
- Verify the task is immediately removed from the TasksList without confirmation dialog
- Verify the StatsDashboard component automatically updates to reflect the new task
  count
- Verify that only the specific components affected by the deletion are re-rendered
  (TasksList and StatsDashboard) while other memoized components remain stable
expected_result: Task should be immediately removed from the task list and the task
  stats (Total Tasks, Active, Completed) should be automatically updated via the memoized
  components
