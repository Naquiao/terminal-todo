name: Component Memoization Functionality
page: Task Management Application
page_path: app/page.tsx
task: Verify that memoized components render correctly and maintain functionality
steps:
- Load the task management application
- Verify the TerminalHeader component displays the current time from useCurrentTime
  hook
- Add a new task using the QuickAddTask component
- Verify the TasksList component updates to show the new task without re-rendering
  other memoized components
- Toggle a task's completion status by clicking its checkbox
- Verify that only the specific TaskItem component updates while other TaskItems remain
  stable
- Change the status filter using the TaskFilters component
- Verify the TasksList updates while other components (TerminalHeader, StatsDashboard)
  remain stable
- Change the category filter in the TaskFilters component
- Verify only relevant components update in response to the filter change
- Delete a task and verify the TasksList updates along with the StatsDashboard showing
  updated task statistics
- Check that the memoized components are preserved across renders by using React DevTools
  or performance monitoring
expected_result: All explicitly memoized components (TerminalHeader, StatsCard, StatsDashboard,
  TaskItem, TasksList, QuickAddTask, TaskFilters) render correctly and maintain their
  expected functionality without unnecessary re-renders when state changes occur in
  other components
