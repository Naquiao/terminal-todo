name: Component Memoization Functionality
page: Task Management Application
page_path: app/page.tsx
task: Verify that memoized components render correctly and maintain functionality
steps:
- Load the task management application
- Add a new task using the QuickAddTask component
- Verify the TasksList component updates to show the new task without full page re-render
- Toggle task completion status by clicking the checkbox
- Verify that only the specific TaskItem component updates (not the entire list)
- Filter tasks by selecting a different status filter
- Verify the TasksList updates while other components (TerminalHeader, StatsDashboard)
  remain stable
- Change the category filter and verify only the relevant components update
- Delete a task and verify the TasksList and StatsDashboard update appropriately
- Verify the TerminalHeader displays the current time and updates it regularly
expected_result: All memoized components (TerminalHeader, StatsCard, StatsDashboard,
  TaskItem, TasksList, etc.) render correctly and maintain their expected functionality
  without unnecessary re-renders
