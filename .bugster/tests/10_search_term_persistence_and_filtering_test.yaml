name: Search Term Persistence and Filtering Test
page: Task Management Application
page_path: app/page.tsx
task: Testing the search term filtering functionality across component re-renders
steps:
- Load the task management application
- Add several tasks with different titles and categories using the QuickAddTask component
- Locate the search input field in the Input component within the QuickAddTask section
- Enter a search term that partially matches text in at least one of the existing
  tasks
- Verify that only the TasksList component re-renders (not TerminalHeader or StatsDashboard)
- Verify that only tasks containing the search term are displayed in the filtered
  list
- Verify that the search highlights or indicates matching results in some way
- Add a new task containing the search term
- Verify the new task appears in the filtered list immediately
- Add a new task that doesn't contain the search term
- Verify this task does not appear in the filtered list
- Clear the search term
- Verify all tasks are now visible in the TasksList component
- Verify that memoized components maintained their state throughout the process
expected_result: Search term should persist and filter tasks correctly even when components
  are memoized and only relevant components should re-render
