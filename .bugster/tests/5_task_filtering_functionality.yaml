name: Task Filtering Functionality
page: /
page_path: app/page.tsx
task: Filtering tasks by category or status
steps:
- Locate the TaskFilters component with status and category options
- Click on a specific status filter ('ALL', 'ACTIVE', or 'COMPLETED') using the handleFilterChange
  callback
- Verify that the TasksList component updates and only displays tasks matching the
  selected status
- Locate the category dropdown in the TaskFilters component
- Click the category dropdown and select a specific category using the handleCategoryFilterChange
  callback
- Verify that the TasksList component updates to show only tasks matching both the
  selected status and category
- If no tasks match the criteria, verify the TasksList displays the 'No tasks found'
  message with the appropriate filter information
- Verify that other memoized components like TerminalHeader and StatsDashboard don't
  re-render during filter changes
expected_result: Only tasks matching the selected filter criteria should be displayed
  in the task list, with the memoized TasksList component showing a 'No tasks found'
  message when no matching tasks exist
