name: Task Search Functionality
page: /
page_path: app/page.tsx
task: Searching for specific tasks using the search input
steps:
- Look for a search input field in the top section of the application
- Enter a search term that matches text in an existing task
- Verify that the memoized TasksList component only displays tasks containing the
  search term
- Verify that non-matching tasks are hidden from view while StatsDashboard still shows
  total task counts
- Clear the search input and verify all tasks appear again in the TasksList component
  without full page re-render
expected_result: Only tasks matching the search query should be displayed in the task
  list with memoized components properly updating
